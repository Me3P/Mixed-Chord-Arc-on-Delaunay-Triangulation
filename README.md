# Mixed-Chord-Arc-on-Delaunay-Triangulation
This project is implementaion of a the best know routing Algorithm on Delaunay Triangulation which has 3.56 Routing ratio.

### Delaunay Triangulation
The Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation which is equivalent to the nerve of the cells in a Voronoi diagram, i.e., that triangulation of the convex hull of the points in the diagram in which every circumcircle of a triangle is an empty circle (Okabe et al. 1992, p. 94)

### Mixed Chord Arc
Mixed chord arc is a routing algorithm for Delaunay Triangulation.
